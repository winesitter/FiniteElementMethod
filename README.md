# Introduction to the Finite Element Method

In this repository I'm trying to give an introduction to the finite element method and how to implement it in code. 

## Gettin' Started
First of all, I want to recommend the great introduction by H.P. Langtangen "Introduction to finite element methods".
Using this document, I wanna try to understand the basics of FEM.
